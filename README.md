# PetfinderQL

This is an Express App that exposes the Petfinder API as a GraphQL server. Likely you know if you are here, but GraphQL is a new query language that allows for flexible querying client side. It allows for the client side code to determine the form that queries are returned, and I have found it very useful to make the Petfinder API to be much easier to use.

## GraphQL

To find out more about GraphQL, their website has excellent tutorials and documentation: https://graphql.org

## Petfinder API

The Petfinder API exposes the huge database of pet information that Petfinder has gathered. According to the website:

>The Petfinder API gives developers access to Petfinder's database of over 300,000 adoptable pets and 11,000 animal welfare organizations (AWO). In addition to searching for adoptable pets on the Petfinder.com web site, you can use the API to create your own dynamic pet web sites or applications, using the same data we use on Petfinder.com.

More documentation about the API that is referenced in this project can be found at https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs
